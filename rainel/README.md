## Motivation

The initial motivation was the fact that I frequently use the federal highways that pass through the surroundings of the Federal District. And since I'm very curious, I decided to look for information about the accidents that happen in them. My intention is to gather information that will help reduce the number of traffic accidents and allow for safer traffic for everyone.

- What are the main federal highways?
- On which road do most accidents happen?
- What is the type of accident that happens the most?
- What month of the year has the most accidents?
- What time of day does most accidents happen?
- On which holiday does the most accident happen?
- In which km does the most accident happen on each road?


## Files

- 3 .csv files containing data on traffic accidents recorded by the Federal Highway Police from 2019 to 2020.
- 11 exploratory notebook in the search for data. In him there are Markdown cells to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
- 1 .py files. It is necessary to obtain the final model used to predict the day that there will be more serious accidents.


## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [`here`](https://medium.com/@raineldias88/there-are-more-traffic-accidents-on-this-road-7933d33476d3)
